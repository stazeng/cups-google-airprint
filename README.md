cups-google-airprint
cups with google cloud print and airprint enabled, with HP and many other printers supported. 
Based on the phusion/baseimage:master branch.

Special notes for Synology users:
Since synology has it's own implementation of CUPS, and it starts automatically with OS boot. It's necessary to disable it berfore we get started. Plus, system level "Bonjour Service discovery --> Printer sharing via Bonjour" must be enabled.

To stop CUPS:
```shell
synoservice --hard-disable cupsd
synoservice --hard-disable cups-lpd
synoservicecfg --hard-disable cupsd
synoservicecfg --hard-disable cups-lpd
synoservicectl --stop cups-lpd
synoservicectl --stop cupsd
```

Also edit /usr/share/init/cups-service-handler.conf with root privilidge and make sure the 3 lines are commented out, otherwise you cannot really stop CUPS from start once printer is reconnected.
```shell
if [ ${PRINTER_NUM} -gt 0 ]; then
        #echo "Printer exist. Start cupsd and cups-lpd." || true
        #/usr/syno/sbin/synoservice --start cupsd || true
        #/usr/syno/sbin/synoservice --start cups-lpd || true
fi
```

Due to FW issues some users may not be able to use the cloud mode of "google cloud print (gcp)", so only local mode is enabled by default. However, this can be easily changed via config file.

Default configuration file for gcp is generated in /config/gcp/gcp-cups-connector.config.json. If you exposed a local folder to config folder to the container, for instance in my case, /volume1/docker/airprint/config, then the file is located in /volume1/docker/airprint/config/gcp/gcp-cups-connector.config.json.

Just change it from:
```json
{ "local_printing_enable": true, "cloud_printing_enable": false, "log_level": "INFO", "log_file_name": "/tmp/cloud-print-connector" }
```
to
```json
{ "local_printing_enable": true, "cloud_printing_enable": true, "log_level": "INFO", "log_file_name": "/tmp/cloud-print-connector" }
```
then restart the container and you are ready to test.

General usage:


Other requirements Host networking (--net="host") appears to be needed for GCP and Avahi to work. On synology NAS, ensure the cups service on Synology OS was disabled. Check the Synology documents for how to disable it. Otherwise, there will be conflicts between the OS and container.

privileged (--privileged="true")

An example startup command: 
```shell
docker run -d --name="airprint" \
--restart=always \
--net=host --privileged="true" \
-e CUPS_USER_ADMIN="admin" \
-e CUPS_USER_PASSWORD="password" \
-v /volume1/docker/airprint/config:/config \
-v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb \
yaurora/cups-google-airprint:primary
```
Or if you don't want to use the host network and to expose mandatory ports (not tested), use:

```shell
docker run -d --name="airprint" \
--restart=always \
--net=bridge --privileged="true" \
-p 631:631 \
-p 5353:5353 \
-e CUPS_USER_ADMIN="admin" \
-e CUPS_USER_PASSWORD="password" \
-v /volume1/docker/airprint/config:/config \
-v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb \
yaurora/cups-google-airprint:primary
```
